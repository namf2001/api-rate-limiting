# API Rate Limiting System

A high-performance rate limiting system built with Go that provides multiple rate limiting algorithms to control API request rates from users, similar to systems used by major APIs like Twitter API and GitHub API.

## Problem Description

This project implements a comprehensive Rate Limiter system that restricts the number of requests from a user within a specific time period. The system is designed to:

- Protect APIs from spam and abuse
- Ensure fair usage among users
- Maintain system performance under high load
- Support enterprise-grade scalability

## Features

### Rate Limiting Algorithms

1. **Fixed Window Rate Limiting**
   - Divides time into fixed windows
   - Simple and memory efficient
   - Good for basic rate limiting needs

2. **Sliding Window Rate Limiting**
   - More flexible than fixed window
   - Provides smoother request distribution
   - Better user experience

3. **Token Bucket Algorithm**
   - Dynamic request rate adjustment
   - Allows burst traffic within limits
   - Most flexible algorithm

### System Requirements

- **Multi-user Support**: Handle concurrent users without performance degradation
- **High Performance**: Optimized for low latency and high throughput
- **Scalability**: Utilizes external resources (Redis, PostgreSQL) for distributed systems
- **Monitoring**: Built-in metrics and logging for rate limit analytics

## Getting Started

## MakeFile

Run build make command with tests
```bash
make all
```

Build the application
```bash
make build
```

Run the application
```bash
make run
```

Create DB container
```bash
make docker-run
```

Shutdown DB Container
```bash
make docker-down
```

DB Integrations Test:
```bash
make itest
```

Live reload the application:
```bash
make watch
```

Run the test suite:
```bash
make test
```

Clean up binary from the last build:
```bash
make clean
```

## API Endpoints

### Rate Limited Endpoints
```bash
# Example protected endpoint
GET /api/v1/users
Headers: 
  X-API-Key: your-api-key
  
Response Headers:
  X-RateLimit-Limit: 100
  X-RateLimit-Remaining: 95
  X-RateLimit-Reset: 1640995200
```

### Admin Endpoints
```bash
# Configure rate limits
POST /admin/rate-limits
{
  "user_id": "user123",
  "algorithm": "token_bucket",
  "limit": 100,
  "window": "1h"
}

# Get rate limit status
GET /admin/rate-limits/:user_id
```

## Configuration

Rate limiting can be configured per user, API key, or globally through environment variables:

```env
# Rate Limiting Settings
RATE_LIMIT_DEFAULT_ALGORITHM=token_bucket
RATE_LIMIT_DEFAULT_LIMIT=100
RATE_LIMIT_DEFAULT_WINDOW=3600s
RATE_LIMIT_REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
```

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive tests for all rate limiting algorithms:

```bash
# Unit tests
make test

# Integration tests with database
make itest

# Load testing
go test -bench=. ./internal/ratelimiter/...
```

## Performance Benchmarks

- **Fixed Window**: ~1M requests/second
- **Sliding Window**: ~800K requests/second  
- **Token Bucket**: ~900K requests/second
- **Memory Usage**: <10MB for 100K concurrent users
